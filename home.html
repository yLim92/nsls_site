<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>The National Society of Leadership and Success is an organization that assists people in discovering and achieving their goals. Members will learn to succeed at their goals through the Society&#39;s leadership speaker series as well as through being part of a community where likeminded success-oriented individuals come together help each other. In addition, not only will the members succeed in their own lives, but they will also create a better world through community service and cooperation.</p>

<p>The core philosophy of the society is for our members to achieve their dreams with meaningful support and dedicated action.</p>

<h2>Customizing This Website for Your Organization</h2>

<p>First off, you most likely want to change the name in the header portion of the site where it says &quot;Organization Name&quot;. This is actually an image, so if you have a logo or banner you would like to fit there please go to the images tab of the website builder and find the image titled <strong>&#39;logo&#39;</strong>. You can simply replace this image using the tools to the right of the name. This image is currently 172 x 52. You can add an image in a different size but it is liable to mess with the displaying of the page.</p>

<p>You can also change the background colors of the header. Access the files/css tab in the website builder and the only file (upon default setup of the site) is a stylesheet. Click <strong>edit</strong> to the right of stylesheet and a dropdown will show up with the CSS file. The first declaration is for body. The second is #header and the third is #navigation . Each of these controls the header and the navigation portions, respectively. The colors are defined on the lines beginning background, and can be changed simply by changing the six values between the &quot;#&quot; and &quot;;&quot;. Here is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors">color chart</a> with many hex code examples.</p>
